# AdditionalFiltersCN

Additional Filters for browser extension based adblockers like (uBlock Origin)[https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock], mainly for Chinese sites, including some obvious trackers which should be found&listed&blocked YEARS ago.

## Q:Why these mess are listed here but not EasyList China?

A:I DON'T accept submitting filters in forums and chat rooms including Fanboy's forum. Those place are for discussion, and they will make the maintenance harder when posts stacked.

Despite the unbelievable simplicity in catching these trackers out, I'll also type a guide for capping trackers in the (wiki)[https://github.com/Crystal-RainSlide/AdditionalFiltersCN/wiki] (may move to other place someday, I'll update this link anyway) to â€¦ try to minimize the possibility of occurrence, of those serious negligences.
