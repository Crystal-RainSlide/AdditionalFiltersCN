### Q: Why this filterlist ... some website(s) ...

**No.** Just point the issue out, directly.

### Q: Why these are listed here but not EasyList China?

A: I DON'T approve submitting filters in forums or chat rooms. Forums and chat rooms are designed for discussion, not massive list data maintenance. Those places don't have enough capacity to match the lists. Obsolete rules are never mentioned after they were created,  undetermined rules are stacked, and the list view don't support tag-based filtering.

Despite the unbelievable simplicity in catching these trackers out, I'll also type a guide for capping trackers in the [wiki](https://github.com/Crystal-RainSlide/AdditionalFiltersCN/wiki) (may move to other place someday... I'll update this link anyway) to ... try to minimize the possibility of occurrence, of those serious negligences.


### Q: Why not use `!#include` but maintain a merger instead?

A: I'd like to keep this filterlist avaliable while make use of all the [uBlock Origin features](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax).
